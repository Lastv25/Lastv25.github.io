            <p>Hi, this website containes the test for the position of Data Engineer in RiverBank.
                All the information to start working on your exercises is contained in the links in the top 
                navigation bar. <br>
                As you might have notice this website was not done to look good or with much time spent on the visual
                aspect. Since that is the case please do not hurt our feelings too much when critisising it. <br>
                Thanks 
            </p>
            <p>Enjoy your work ^^.
            </p>
